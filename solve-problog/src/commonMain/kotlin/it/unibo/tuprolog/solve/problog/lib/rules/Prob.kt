/**
 * This rule represents a single goal in the probabilistic resolution. The first argument is a term representing
 * the [ProbExplanation] explanations of a goal's solutions, and the second argument represents the probabilistic
 * goal itself. The rule returns a sequence containing all the substitutions for the goal, which are
 * all its solutions and their corresponding explanation in the form of [ProbExplanationTerm].
 *
 * The computation uses regular Prolog SLD resolution semantics. Solutions are not grouped and the resolution
 * uses a depth-first approach.
 *
 * This rule also handles backwards compatibility with Prolog.
 *
 * It is worth mentioning that no probability is calculated by this primitive. Instead, this just bundles the logic
 * for finding probabilistic goal solutions and their explanation.
 *
 * Under the hood, this used [ProbHelper] to compute some imperative business logic and map the goal into a
 * more appropriate form, and then calls it.
