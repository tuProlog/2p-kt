/**
 * Implements a [ClauseMapper] that handles the case of Probabilistic Annotated Disjunctions.
 * Those are a specific kind of [Clause]s in which the head is composed by a set of disjoint terms.
 * During probabilistic query resolution a clause of this kind can only be selected with only one
 * of its heads, so that it can't happen to have two different heads from the same annotate disjoint clause
 * present in the same solution and having the same substitution.
 *
 * Explanations including this kind of clauses usually involve knowledge compilation into
 * Multi-Value Decision Diagrams (MDDs) to support them natively. However, this usually requires a secondary
 * knowledge compilation process from MDDs to another data structure with more package/module support.
 * In our solution, we avoid the usage of MDDs by pre-computing a [ProbExplanation] with all the binary splits and
 * negations necessary to support Annotated Disjoint clauses.
