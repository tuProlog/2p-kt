/**
 * This interface represents an explanation of a probabilistic logic query over a given probabilistic theory.
 * By "explanation" we refer to the collection of terms used to compute a logic solution for a query.
 * This can be also seen as a boolean formula in which each boolean variable is represented by Prolog terms,
 * and as such fundamental logic operators are supported (not, and, or).
 *
 * Terms are represented by the [ProbTerm] class.
 *
 * This also acts as an abstraction for the underlying knowledge compilation system. In fact, state of the art
 * probabilistic logic programming research attempts involve the compilation of logic explanations in specific data
 * structures suitable for optimized Weighted Model Checking, that is used to compute the probability over
 * queries' solutions. Most popular proposals include Binary Decision Diagrams (BDD),
 * Decomposable Negation Normal Form circuit (d-DNNF), and Sentential Decision Diagrams (SDD).
 *
 * Instances of this interface must be immutable.
